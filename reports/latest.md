## 4. Ensemble Regime Probability

| Regime | Ensemble Probability | Interpretation | 中文解释 |
|---|---:|---|---|
| R0 | 73.3% | High-rate absorption | 高利率吸收 |
| R1 | 14.3% | Bear steepening + dollar pressure | 熊市陡峭化 + 美元压力 |
| R2 | 5.0% | Credit / sovereign stress spillover | 信用 / 主权压力外溢 |
| R3 | 7.4% | Rate decline / policy repair | 利率下行 / 政策修复 |

## 5. Rule Engine Probability

| Regime | Rule Posterior | Interpretation | 中文解释 |
|---|---:|---|---|
| R0 | 66.2% | High-rate absorption | 高利率吸收 |
| R1 | 18.2% | Bear steepening + dollar pressure | 熊市陡峭化 + 美元压力 |
| R2 | 6.4% | Credit / sovereign stress spillover | 信用 / 主权压力外溢 |
| R3 | 9.2% | Rate decline / policy repair | 利率下行 / 政策修复 |

## 6. Robust Statistical Layer

### Student-t Observation Filter

- Used: **True**
- Method: Student-t observation filter + Markov transition smoothing
- Usable rows: 1272
- Available feature count: 13
- Top statistical regime: R0
- Warnings: State R2 has only 5 pseudo-labeled rows; using global robust scale.

| Regime | Student-t Filter Probability | Interpretation | 中文解释 |
|---|---:|---|---|
| R0 | 99.9% | High-rate absorption | 高利率吸收 |
| R1 | 0.0% | Bear steepening + dollar pressure | 熊市陡峭化 + 美元压力 |
| R2 | 0.0% | Credit / sovereign stress spillover | 信用 / 主权压力外溢 |
| R3 | 0.0% | Rate decline / policy repair | 利率下行 / 政策修复 |

### Robust Change-Point / Transition Risk

- Used: **True**
- Risk level: **low**
- Risk score: **10.2%**
- Robust distance: 1.15
- Stress votes: 0/8
- Warnings: none

## 7. Signal Evidence

- **R0**: 10Y yield is high but not accelerating; equity resilience with stable credit; DXY is stable
- **R1**: credit spread pressure is not yet disorderly
- **R2**: no strong evidence
- **R3**: no strong evidence

## 8. Markov Prior

| Regime | Prior | Interpretation | 中文解释 |
|---|---:|---|---|
| R0 | 55.0% | High-rate absorption | 高利率吸收 |
| R1 | 25.0% | Bear steepening + dollar pressure | 熊市陡峭化 + 美元压力 |
| R2 | 6.0% | Credit / sovereign stress spillover | 信用 / 主权压力外溢 |
| R3 | 14.0% | Rate decline / policy repair | 利率下行 / 政策修复 |

## 9. Risk Alerts

- R1 continuation: **not confirmed**
- R2 upgrade warning: **not confirmed**
- R2 transition risk: **low**
- R3 policy-repair signal: **not confirmed**

## 10. Interpretation

### Verified market data

The report uses FRED for US Treasury yields and credit OAS series, and Yahoo Finance for ETF/index market proxies where available.

### Computed indicators

The system computes 5D, 20D, and 60D changes. ETF/index moves are percentage returns. Yield and spread moves are basis-point changes.

### Model inference

The final state is the highest ensemble probability regime. The ensemble combines:

1. deterministic rule posterior;
2. robust Student-t observation filter with Markov transition smoothing;
3. robust change-point / transition-risk score.

### Judgment discipline

Do not upgrade to R2 from rates and equity weakness alone. R2 requires credit-spread stress, sovereign-spread stress, or synchronized deleveraging across equities, EM, credit, and high-duration assets.

## 11. Next Data to Watch

1. HY OAS 20D change
2. HYG 20D return
3. DXY level and 20D return
4. IWM/SPY and EEM/SPY relative performance
5. US 10Y and 30Y yield levels
6. Change-point risk score and Student-t filter disagreement with the rule engine
